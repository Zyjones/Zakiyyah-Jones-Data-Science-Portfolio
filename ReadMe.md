# Data Science Portfolio - Zakiyyah Jones
I am Zakiyyah Jones! Through my work in special education as a Registered Behavioral Technician, I witnessed how meaningful insights from data can transform behavioral interventions. Now, Iâ€™m transitioning into a career in data science, combining my problem-solving mindset with technical skills in SQL and Python to uncover insights that lead to real-world impact. This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.
